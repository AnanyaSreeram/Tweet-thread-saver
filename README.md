# Thrice-As-Nice
This project is solely intended for twitter users.The agenda of our project is to enable a twitter user to obtain the preferential threads/tweets as a direct message.This can achieved by the user on tagging our twitter bot namely @tweet_neat_ on the required threads. We believe that its done to ease the twitter user's priorities in reference to tweets/threads readability access.And we believe that it was an awesome experience as the saying goes all is well that ends well:)..

## How it works?
1.This twitter bot namely @tweet_neat_ works on getting tagged.It responds to the mentioned tweets and accesses the particular tweets id and the text enrolled and sends the same to the user as a direct message via a user id which it fetches on getting tagged.

2.Since twitter has a prerequiste that two user accounts must follow each other in other to retrieve, get and post direct messages, our bot at first checks whether the user accounts are mutually following each other or not.In order to post direct messages it uses a function follow() in case the user isnt being followed. And that is how the tweet/thread is sent to the authenticated user via dm.

## Libraries used
1.pip - 21.1.1(by default in any venv)

2.setuptools - 57.0.0(by default in any venv)

3.pathlib - 1.0.0

4.tweepy - 3.10.0(including six-1.16.0 , requests - 2.25.1, oauthlib - 3.1.0, certifi - 2020.12.5, chardet - 4.0.0, urllib3 - 1.26.4, idna - 2.10, pysocks - 1.7.1)

5.python-dotenv - 0.17.1

6.Datetime - 4.3(extras)

7.export - 0.1.2(extras)

8.pathlib - 1.0.1(extras)

## How to configure
step 1: In order to develop a twitter bot with the same functionality, one must apply for a twitter developer account which can either get acceptance in 1 or maximum 2 days.
        After applying for dev account one may obtain a mail verification mail and 1/2 other mails from the Twitter Developer Account regarding the same.
        Once the developer account gets confirmed the person will get a sanctioned mail giving the accessibilty to the same.
        
step 2: One must sign in to the deveoper portal create a app with certain basic settings(most importantly give the app access to read, write and post dm's) and henceforth do         the most critical part i.e. generate the API and Access keys and secrets for availing it into the code to access Twitter API for the twitter bot.

step 3: Another important part is the installation of tweepy library which is a Python library for accessing the Twitter API. It is great for simple automation and creating           twitter bots.Further installation of python libraries and coding should be done.

## How to run
step 4: After the successful coding part in order to test the working of twitter bot the user must keep another handy twitter account for the same.

step 5: From the other account tag the twitter bot created on a tweet thread for testing.

step 6: While running the program and testing from the other account, one must make sure to follow the twitter bot from the other account or else allow the settings of               accepting direct messages from everyone.

step 7: In order to confirm the program's successful run its best recommended to install twitter app and check whether the thread/tweet in which you
        tagged the bot pops up in you dm or not:)..
