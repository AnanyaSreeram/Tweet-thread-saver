# Thrice-As-Nice
This project is solely intended for twitter users.The agenda of our project is to enable a twitter user to obtain the preferential threads/tweets as a direct message.This can achieved by the user on tagging our twitter bot namely @tweet_neat_ on the required threads. We believe that its done to ease the twitter user's priorities in reference to tweets/threads readability access.And we believe that it was an awesome experience as the saying goes all is well that ends well:)..

## How it works?
1.This twitter bot namely @tweet_neat_ works on getting tagged.It responds to the mentioned tweets and accesses the particular tweets id and the text enrolled and sends the same to the user as a direct message via a user id which it fetches on getting tagged.
2.Since twitter has a prerequiste that two user accounts must follow each other in other to retrieve, get and post direct messages, our bot at first checks whether the user accounts are mutually following each other or not.In order to post direct messages it uses a function follow() in case the user isnt being followed. And that is how the tweet/thread is sent to the authenticated user via dm.
